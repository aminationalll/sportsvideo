üîä Are the Icelanders capable of delivering a respectable home game? In the first playoff match of the Conference League, Vikingur will face Panathinaikos. The Greeks are the favorites in this matchup, and by a considerable margin. There is a high probability that they will settle all questions in the first game. Especially since the Icelandic team will play in their country, but not on their home ground. Our editorial prediction will guide you on what is best to bet on in this case.

Head-to-Head
The teams have not played against each other before.


Vikingur Reykjavik
Team Overview
The success of the team from Reykjavik at the end of the overall stage of the Conference League can be considered a real miracle. Vikingur is showing quite mediocre play, and even in Iceland, they are not highly regarded. In the last five matches, the "Vikings" have suffered four defeats. If they hadn't managed to beat Cercle Brugge (3:1) or Borac (2:0) thanks to discipline and the home-field advantage, they definitely wouldn't be in the playoffs.

All leagues


Team Overview
This club is considered one of the best representatives of Greece on the world stage, regularly making it to European competitions. However, it is not going through the best of times right now. In the Greek Super League, Panathinaikos is only in third place. Their unbeaten streak of 17 matches was interrupted by two consecutive defeats. Therefore, there are questions regarding the club's readiness to advance significantly in the Conference League.



‚öΩÔ∏è Prediction on Goals
The previous four defeats of Vikingur were significant, with the Icelanders conceding at least three goals in each game. Here they are set to play as clear underdogs. Therefore, it is worth betting on Panathinaikos Individual Total Goals Over 1.5.

üö© Prediction on Corners
In matches involving Panathinaikos, an average of 10.1 corners are taken, with the Greek team often dominating in this aspect. In the upcoming match, they are expected to play as the leading team, so their chances of earning many set pieces are very high. Our editorial team advises betting on Total Corners Over 9.5.

Editor's Prediction
Panathinaikos has a good chance to settle all questions about who should play in the tournament's round of 16 in the first match itself. Vikingur is currently unable to compete even with Icelandic teams, so it will be hard for them to find a way to withstand the onslaught of one of Greece's best clubs. We predict that Panathinaikos will win with a score of 3-1.

And the guests are unlikely to be satisfied with a minimal victory, as the guys from Reykjavik have allowed their previous opponents to roam freely in their penalty area too easily. Therefore, our editorial team suggests betting
